        <item>We make a software engineer out of you. You\'re going to be working on the development of software for many different applications. You will be able to analyse, design and implement complex IT systems.\n\nSoftware is all around us. You are the specialist in creating large and complex software information systems that work fast, safe and efficiently. For example, think about developing a functional app, but also about analyzing large amounts of data from social media. While developing these systems, you will come into contact with many different programming languages. In the first year, you\'ll learn to program in Python and the more advanced programming languages Java and C#. From the second year on, you will decide for yourself what programming language(s) you want to use. In addition to programming and developing software, you will also learn to cooperate in a team.\n\nAfter completing the Software Engineering course, you will be equipped with knowledge and abilities for a wide range of careers within the area. From positions like data engineer, software developer and software engineer, you will be able to keep growing in IT indefinitely.\n\nAre you interested in the latest technological developments? Are you curious, a little quirky, and someone who follows through? The Software Engineering course may be what you\'re looking for!</item>

        <item>Do you have a keen eye and ear on the stories behind brands and people? Are you creative with text and image, and fascinated by the world of media? Then the Communication course may be what you\'re looking for!\n\nOrganisations face major challenges. Promoting a new product, working with clients, employees and inhabitants, showing that you\'re doing good things for society. How do you manage, in this time of critical journalism, vlogging, societal discussions and rapidly changing trends?\n\nIn four years, our Communication course will turn you into a, what we proudly call, smart connector. A professional that can create smart connections. Using for example social tools, storytelling, big data and co-creation. You will be developing creative concepts such as media campaigns, events and story platforms. Based on good research, theory and strategy, and of course your own surprising ideas.\n\nFrom year 1 you\'ll be working with clients from the real world. From entrepreneurs from Rotterdam, start-ups and bureaus to national organizations. We work with innovative methods. You\'ll be working with the Scrum method, in which you flexibly and intensively work with the client. No class, course or project is the same. We will change the work type to what you learn: webinars, TED Talks, content cafés, meet-ups, guest lessons and company visits.</item>
