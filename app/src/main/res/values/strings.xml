        <item>We make a software engineer out of you. You\'re going to be working on the development of software for many different applications. You will be able to analyse, design and implement complex IT systems.\n\nSoftware is all around us. You are the specialist in creating large and complex software information systems that work fast, safe and efficiently. For example, think about developing a functional app, but also about analyzing large amounts of data from social media. While developing these systems, you will come into contact with many different programming languages. In the first year, you\'ll learn to program in Python and the more advanced programming languages Java and C#. From the second year on, you will decide for yourself what programming language(s) you want to use. In addition to programming and developing software, you will also learn to cooperate in a team.\n\nAfter completing the Software Engineering course, you will be equipped with knowledge and abilities for a wide range of careers within the area. From positions like data engineer, software developer and software engineer, you will be able to keep growing in IT indefinitely.\n\nAre you interested in the latest technological developments? Are you curious, a little quirky, and someone who follows through? The Software Engineering course may be what you\'re looking for!</item>

        <item>Do you have a keen eye and ear on the stories behind brands and people? Are you creative with text and image, and fascinated by the world of media? Then the Communication course may be what you\'re looking for!\n\nOrganisations face major challenges. Promoting a new product, working with clients, employees and inhabitants, showing that you\'re doing good things for society. How do you manage, in this time of critical journalism, vlogging, societal discussions and rapidly changing trends?\n\nIn four years, our Communication course will turn you into a, what we proudly call, smart connector. A professional that can create smart connections. Using for example social tools, storytelling, big data and co-creation. You will be developing creative concepts such as media campaigns, events and story platforms. Based on good research, theory and strategy, and of course your own surprising ideas.\n\nFrom year 1 you\'ll be working with clients from the real world. From entrepreneurs from Rotterdam, start-ups and bureaus to national organizations. We work with innovative methods. You\'ll be working with the Scrum method, in which you flexibly and intensively work with the client. No class, course or project is the same. We will change the work type to what you learn: webinars, TED Talks, content cafés, meet-ups, guest lessons and company visits.</item>

        <item>At our school, studying often looks different. As a designer, you will not spend as much time in classrooms in the traditional way. We work together in the studio, for real clients.\n\nYou will design meaningful interactive products and services for the human being: from websites, apps, interactive setups, to full-on experience. Before you start designing, you will do elaborate research into the needs of the users and the environment in which your interactive design will be implemented. You will continuously check in with the client for whom you are designing, and you will also visit them on location. After all, designing is: making prototypes, testing, failing, redesigning, testing, adjusting, et cetera. You\'ll be busy sketching, researching and building on location. You will learn how to work around the needs and experience of the users and the clients. A pro-active attitude is a prerequisite for the designing process in Communication and Multimedia Design, as well as a healthy dose of curiosity, guts, and independence to deliver high quality work. We also expect you to be able to have a critical look at your own work, and act accordingly.\n\nThe first-year students now focus on elderly people that in some way experience physical or mental health problems and need caregiving. The client is seeking smart, new technological applications that will allow elderly people to live at home with the help of caregivers.\n\nThe CMD course challenges you to use your knowledge, creativity and talents for design for interactive products and services, that will improve the lives and environments of the people that use them.</item>
